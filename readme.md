# **Django Model Practice Repository**

## **Description**
This repository is dedicated to practising Django model relationships, focusing on real-world business scenarios. Each app within this repository is designed to address a specific business logic problem that requires the implementation of Django models and ORM functionalities.

### **Purpose**
The aim is to develop practical skills with Djangoâ€™s model system, including ForeignKey, ManyToMany, and OneToOne relationships, while leveraging the Django admin interface to interact with the models. This project deliberately avoids the complexity of a full user interface, allowing for a concentrated focus on backend development.


## **Key Features**
- **Problem-Solving Approach**: Each app presents a distinct business problem, complete with requirements and scenarios that guide model design and implementation.
- **Model-Focused**: Solutions are centred around creating and implementing models, defining relationships, and enforcing business logic.
- **Admin Interface Interaction**: All model management and testing are conducted through the Django admin interface, facilitating easy experimentation and interaction with the models.
- **No UI**: This project focuses solely on backend functionality, avoiding the need for frontend development. To play with the models
you need only log into the admin interface

## **Apps Overview**
Each app contains a README or scenario file outlining the specific business context, requirements, and model design. Key apps include:

- **Event Management System**: Handle events, attendees, roles, and sessions.
- **Library Management System**: Manage books, authors, members, and borrowing activities.
